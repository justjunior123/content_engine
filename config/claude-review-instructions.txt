# AUTOMATED ASSET REVIEW PROTOCOL
# Instructions for Claude Desktop via MCP Tools

## ACTIVATION TRIGGER
When you are asked to check the review queue or process pending campaigns, follow this protocol:

## STEP 1: CHECK REVIEW QUEUE
1. Read the file `temp/review_queue.txt` (in the project directory)
2. If empty or non-existent, respond: "No campaigns in review queue"
3. If contains campaign paths, process the FIRST campaign path listed

## STEP 2: CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS
For the campaign directory found in the queue:

### A. Read Campaign Context
- Read `campaign_brief.json` to understand:
  - Products being marketed
  - Brand guidelines (colors, fonts, tone)
  - Target audience and region  
  - Campaign message
  - Prohibited content list
  - Required elements list

### B. Inventory All Assets
- List all PNG files in the campaign directory structure
- Note the format types: 1:1 (square), 9:16 (story/vertical), 16:9 (landscape)
- Read associated metadata.json files for generation details

## STEP 3: COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW
For EACH PNG asset, evaluate on these criteria:

### Brand Compliance (Weight: 40%)
- **Colors**: Do the colors match the brand guidelines?
- **Required Elements**: Are logos, copyright notices, and required text present?
- **Brand Tone**: Does the visual style match the specified tone (e.g., "professional yet inspiring")?
- **Font Usage**: Are the correct brand fonts being used in text overlays?

### Content Appropriateness (Weight: 30%)
- **Prohibited Content**: Check against the prohibited content list
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Appropriate for target region and audience
- **Legal Compliance**: No misleading claims or inappropriate representations
- **Message Clarity**: Campaign message is clear and prominent

### Visual Quality (Weight: 20%)
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, polished, marketing-ready aesthetic
- **Composition**: Well-balanced, visually appealing layout
- **Image Resolution**: Sharp, high-quality appearance
- **Text Legibility**: All text is readable at intended viewing size

### Format Optimization (Weight: 10%)
- **Aspect Ratio Compliance**: Correctly formatted for intended platform
- **Safe Areas**: Important elements not in crop-risk zones
- **Platform Best Practices**: Optimized for social media viewing

## STEP 4: SCORING SYSTEM
Rate each asset on a 1-10 scale:

- **10**: Perfect - Ready for immediate deployment
- **9**: Excellent - Minor aesthetic enhancements possible
- **8**: Very Good - Small brand compliance tweaks recommended
- **7**: Good - Some adjustments needed but fundamentally sound
- **6**: Acceptable - Moderate revisions required
- **5**: Below Standard - Significant issues need addressing
- **4**: Poor - Major brand compliance problems
- **3**: Unacceptable - Substantial rework required
- **2**: Severely Deficient - Complete redesign needed
- **1**: Failed - Does not meet basic requirements

## STEP 5: UPDATE REVIEW STATUS
Update the `review_status.json` file with this structure:

```json
{
  "campaignId": "[existing campaign ID]",
  "status": "review_completed",
  "createdAt": "[existing timestamp]",
  "lastModified": "[current timestamp]",
  "totalAssets": "[existing count]",
  "successfulAssets": "[existing count]",
  "assetsGenerated": "[existing array]",
  "claudeReviewed": true,
  "complianceScore": "[average score across all assets]",
  "reviewStarted": "[current timestamp]",
  "reviewCompleted": "[current timestamp]",
  "detailedFindings": {
    "overallAssessment": "[PASS/CONDITIONAL_PASS/FAIL]",
    "averageScore": "[numerical average]",
    "assetScores": {
      "[asset_filename]": {
        "score": "[1-10]",
        "brandCompliance": "[score/10]",
        "contentAppropriateness": "[score/10]",
        "visualQuality": "[score/10]",
        "formatOptimization": "[score/10]",
        "issues": ["[specific issue 1]", "[specific issue 2]"],
        "recommendations": ["[specific recommendation 1]", "[specific recommendation 2]"]
      }
    },
    "criticalIssues": ["[list any blocking issues]"],
    "recommendations": ["[overall campaign-level recommendations]"],
    "nextSteps": "[what should happen next]"
  }
}
```

## STEP 6: CREATE GMAIL DRAFT
Create a Gmail draft with this structure:

**Subject**: `Campaign Review Complete: [campaignId] - [PASS/CONDITIONAL_PASS/FAIL]`

**Body**:
```
CAMPAIGN REVIEW SUMMARY
Campaign ID: [campaignId]
Review Completed: [timestamp]
